Create an ASCII HTML page from your images with just a few clicks.

There are programs that convert [ASCII Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) into HTML in real graphic formats. This can be done easily by hand, initially by taking a screenshot of the window containing the ASCII graphic. However, the effort required for scalable graphics is greater.

In the 1960s, [Andries van Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andries_van_Dam) published a representation of an electronic circuit produced on an [IBM 1403](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1403) line printer. At the same time, [Kenneth Knowlton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Knowlton) was producing realistic images, also on line printers, by overprinting several characters on top of one another. Note that it was not ASCII art in a sense that the 1403 was driven by an [EBCDIC-Coded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC) platform and the character sets and trains available on the 1403 were derived from EBCDIC rather than ASCII, despite some glyphs commonalities.

The widespread usage of ASCII art can be traced to the computer [bulletin board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) systems of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The limitations of computers of that time period necessitated the use of text characters to represent images. Along with ASCII's use in communication, however, it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period.

### Have fun with ASCii!
