Create an ASCII HTML page from your images with just a few clicks.

There are programs that convert ASCII graphics into images in real graphic formats. This can be done easily by hand, initially by taking a screenshot of the window containing the ASCII graphic. However, the effort required for scalable graphics is greater.
Result of an automatic conversion with the "JavE" program
There are also programs and program libraries that convert images and videos into ASCII images (aalib) or ASCII movies (aaplayer). Interpreting the original graphic as a template for line drawing is rare. Image brightness is often achieved by the area coverage of the characters used. The JavE program, for example, allows you to influence the result of such a conversion by selecting different character groups and changing the brightness and contrast of the template. Such automatic conversions usually produce very large images; for smaller formats, the quality is usually unsatisfactory without extensive manual post-processing, depending on the image source.
When using OpenGL on ATI graphics cards under Windows, there is a so-called “smart shader” (a real-time shader-based calculation effect) that displays the rendered image data as ASCII art on the screen.

Video players like MPlayer and VLC Media Player can play videos as monochrome or color ASCII art. They rely on the free program libraries AAlib (monochrome) and libcaca (color). The latter also includes programs for displaying and converting graphics to ASCII art and supports Unicode.
There are also apps for smartphones that convert camera images live into ASCII graphics. One example is AsciiCam for Android.
ASCII and HTML images are two visual arts created by the internet and the information age. This art, particularly impressive for tech enthusiasts, is based on combining fonts into photographic images.
There are also versions of this art with colorful characters. Portraits and images made from colorful mosaics look impressive. If you like these images, you can now easily create your own ASCII and HTML images. You can share the nostalgic and retro results.
